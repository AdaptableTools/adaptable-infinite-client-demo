# Adaptable Infinite for React 


## Setting up the Adaptable license key

Either create an `.env.local` env file or use the already existing `.env` file, and add the following line for setting up your Adaptable license key

```sh
VITE_ADAPTABLE_INFINITE_LICENSE_KEY=...
```

> If you use the `.env` file, make sure you don't commit the license key to git.


## Running the demo

```sh
npm run dev
```
